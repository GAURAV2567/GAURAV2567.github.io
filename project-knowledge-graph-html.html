                    <p>People Analytics Knowledge Graph: Advanced Skills Discovery and Workforce Insights</p>
                    <p>The NASA People Analytics Knowledge Graph is an innovative project leveraging graph database technology to revolutionize human capital management and skills discovery across the agency. <br/>Key features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comprehensive Data Integration: Combines diverse data sources including employee information, occupations, training records, and mission data into a unified knowledge graph.</li>
                        <li>Advanced Skills Identification: Utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques (e.g., Doc2Vec) to extract and infer skills from various textual sources.</li>
                        <li>Dynamic Relationship Mapping: Establishes connections between employees, skills, occupations, and training, enabling multidimensional analysis of workforce capabilities.</li>
                        <li>Predictive Analytics: Employs graph algorithms and data science techniques to identify skills gaps, suggest career paths, and support succession planning.</li>
                        <li>Talent Marketplace: Facilitates internal job matching by comparing employee profiles with job requirements based on identified skills and competencies.</li>
                        <li>Strategic Workforce Alignment: Provides insights into skill distribution across projects, programs, and missions, supporting strategic decision-making.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><br/>This project demonstrates expertise in graph database design, machine learning, natural language processing, and the application of advanced analytics to solve complex organizational challenges in workforce management.</p>
